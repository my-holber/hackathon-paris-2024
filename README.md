# Hackathon in Paris - December 2024

Welcome to the repository I created after participating in the Hackathon in Paris, which took place on December 3, 2024. In this file, I share my thoughts on our participation in this event and what we learned in such a short time.

## About the Hackathon

- Date: December 3, 2024  
- Duration: 20–24 hours  
- Location: Paris, France  
- Team size: 6 participants  

This hackathon was a real challenge for our team. We worked under time pressure, but gained a huge amount of experience that will help us in the future. The hackathon gave us the opportunity to test our skills and understand what we are capable of in a limited amount of time.

## Our Team

### 1. Participant jydzip

- Role: Front-end and back-end developer, idea initiator  
- Description: This participant had prior programming experience and worked the most. They not only handled front-end development but also actively worked on the back-end, came up with ideas, and solved architectural tasks related to the project.  

### 2. Participant ForgetG
- Role: Back-end developer  
- Description: This participant had limited programming experience. Nevertheless, they made an important contribution to the server-side development and actively collaborated with the team to implement functionality.

### 3. Participant my-holber
- Role: Back-end developer  
- Description: This participant also worked on the back-end, helping to create the server-side logic and solve coding issues. Despite limited experience, they took initiative and actively participated in the process.

### 4. Participant Raphaeldott
- Role: Developer focusing on computer vision  
- Description: This participant started programming only two months ago and is learning C. However, they successfully implemented the computer vision part using Google’s API. They used Python — a programming language they had never worked with before. It was a real challenge for them, but they handled it well.

### 5. Participant 5  
- Role: UX Designer  
- Description: Responsible for design and user experience. They created interface mockups, thought about usability, and helped the team improve the project's visual aspects.

### 6. Participant ChongLeangUENG
- Role: Team organizer, presenter, and logistics  
- Description: Although this participant didn’t write any code, they played a key role in forming the team, ensuring resources were available, and organizing the workflow. They also presented the project to the judges and made sure everything was ready for the successful completion of the hackathon.

## My Thoughts on the Hackathon

This hackathon was a unique opportunity to test what we are capable of in such extreme conditions. We all worked under time pressure, and despite the fact that for some of us it was our first experience, we managed to achieve great results.

The most valuable aspect of the hackathon, in my opinion, was realizing how important it is to work as a team, make decisions quickly, and adapt to changing conditions. This was not only a technical growth experience but also a lesson in organizing efficient work with limited time resources.

## Conclusion

The hackathon in Paris was a true challenge but also a major achievement for our team. We not only developed our technical skills but also learned to work under stress and tight deadlines. We will definitely continue to build on the knowledge gained and work on new projects!

## A Small Note on the Results

It is disappointing that the judges at the hackathon had no experience in programming and weren’t professional developers. This became evident when they didn’t ask any questions related to the code, technologies, or the implementation of the project. Instead, it seemed they were more marketing professionals who assessed projects not based on technical achievements but rather the visual presentation and theoretical part. Of course, we understand that presentation matters, but in the context of a hackathon, where real results are expected, it leaves a certain aftertaste.
We hope that in the future, the organizers will be more careful in choosing judges and will focus more on the technical work of the teams, rather than just the visual or theoretical aspects of the project.

Thanks for your attention! We are really glad that we were able to participate in this hackathon and look forward to new opportunities!
